# Palindrome Checker

This program, written in RISC-V assembly language, checks if a given input string is a palindrome.

## Description

A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters that reads the same backward as forward (e.g., "madam" or "racecar"). This program takes a string as input and determines whether it is a palindrome.

### Input

The program accepts a single string from standard input, with a maximum length of 31 characters.

### Output

The program outputs a single character to standard output.
*   '1' if the input string is a palindrome.
*   '0' if the input string is not a palindrome.

## How to Run

To run this program, you will need a RISC-V assembler and a simulator.
1.  Assemble the source file `palindrome-checker.S` into an executable file.
2.  Load the executable file into a RISC-V simulator.
3.  Run the program.
4.  Provide a string as input when prompted.
5.  The program will then output '1' or '0' based on whether the string is a palindrome.
